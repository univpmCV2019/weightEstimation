"Evaluation of Features from RGB-D Data for Human Body Weight Estimation
Background"

Human weight estimation is useful in a variety of potential applications, e.g. targeted
advertisement, entertainment scenarios and forensic science. However, estimating weight only
from color cues is particularly challenging since these cues are quite sensitive to lighting and
imaging conditions.
Task:
The task consists of proposing a novel weight estimator based on RGB-D videos, which utilizes
the visual color cues and depth information. The approach will be tested on TVPR dataset,
which includes RGB-D videos of different people with ground truth weight.
Evaluation criteria:
The evaluation will be based on the following criteria:
• Performances of the implemented networks
• Originality of proposed new solutions
• Problem solving capabilities of the group
